# Southern Literature Map Data

This repository stores the map data created for *ENG 355: Southern Literature*, a digital humanities project that maps characters, purchases, and movements across four novels. The data was collaboratively generated by students and is intended for use in Mapbox Studio or other GIS tools.

The four novels represented are:

- *Their Eyes Were Watching God*
- *The Color Purple*
- *Salvage the Bones*
- *Shell Shaker*

The data is organized by **subdirectory** inside the `refined_data` folder.  
Each novel‚Äôs data is stored in a folder named after the novel (e.g., `color_purple`).

---

## üìÇ Folder structure

Within each novel folder are four CSV files, one for each dataset:

- `<novel>_items_purchased_by_location.csv`
- `<novel>_location_type_count.csv`
- `<novel>_purchased_from_location.csv`
- `<novel>_purchaser_location.csv`

_(Replace `<novel>` with the folder name for each novel, e.g., `color_purple`.)_
